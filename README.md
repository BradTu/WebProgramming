# Web Programming

## Project 1

This project only uses html. To open up the website download the files
and right click on "Homepage.html" and open it with whatever browser 
you use. You can navigate through the website using the links provided on it.

This website is a blog with recipes on it. There are three pages on it.
One is the Homepage.html. This is the main page of the website. It has a
website description on it. It has links to two different recipes. It also
has the form inputs to it. In theory the user could give their email, name,
agree to website terms, select the date and submit the form.

The next page is a recipe for jambalaya. It includes a recipe and ingredients
to make jambalaya. As well as a description of what jambalaya is and
directions on how to make it. The recipe is from food network.

The other recipe is for a garlic burger. It has the recipe and ingredients.
It has a description of burgers and directions on how to make it. This
recipe is provided by me. This page also has a table that compares some
of the most unhealthy fast food burgers.

The design of the website is pretty simple and straight forward. Every page
has headers, footers and navigation links to every other page. Both the
jambalaya and burger page have images. The burger page has the table that
uses rowspan and colspan. Both the jambalaya and burger page have unordered
lists. The homepage has the form, fieldset and input features.

## Project 2

This project uses html, css and javascript. To open up the website download the files
and right click on "Homepage.html" and open it with whatever browser 
you use. You can navigate through the website using the navigation bar.

I decided to use my website from project 1 and to build off of it.
I used the same general format of the website in terms of the html. I added
a couple more recipes to the website. I also added a navigation bar.

In terms of css there are two files. One for the homepage that is specifically
tailored to it and the content there. I used another one for the recipe
pages because they all have the same format in terms of html. I added
all sorts of styles, colors, and changes to fonts. I made a navigation bar
using css. There are some transitions in there as well.

For javascript each page has its own javascript file. For the recipe pages
they allow the user to scroll through the images of the ingredients by
pressing on the image itself. The recipe pages also have a comment section
at the bottom. You can type into the textfield and submit it and it will
dynamically appear at the bottom of the screen. Although it will not save
the comments if you leave the page. For the home page I added more to the
user subscription section. I added a feature for the user to make an "icon"
for their "account". You can enter a background color by entering a useable
hexadecimal value or an rgb value. Then you can add text to the first line and
you can add text to the second line as well. These have to be done in order
and you must hit each submit button to see the changes on the canvas. Again
this has to be done in order.
